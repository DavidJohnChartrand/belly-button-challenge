# belly-button-challenge
## Goals
In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset linked to an external site, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

a live version of this code can be access at: https://davidjohnchartrand.github.io/bellyButtionBiodiversity.github.oi/
